***HACKTHEBOX:BANKHEIST:WRITEUP***

FIRST THOUGHTS
 * Seems like an old flip phone texting scheme

Tried a few online decoders (as it would be less tiring than manually decoding)
 * Looked at output
 * All meaningless
 * Looked for real words
 * Found GIHON (Jewish river)
 * Realized this might not be the best route

Began manually deciphering flag
 * Starts becoming readable immediately
 * Slowly decipher the text
 * Get to the end

Attempt to submit the flag
 * Tried several different part of the ouput
 * Ended up being a concious typo on the Author's behalf that we needed to submit

Was successful
