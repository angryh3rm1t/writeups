PLAN
 * Find username
 * Fine password

FIND username
 * Looked through code, tried 'slither'. Didn't work.
 * Noticed that 'slither' was a variable, and that it was declared as several smaller variables
 * Each smaller variable was declated as a gexidecimal value
 * Converted each hex value to decimal, then concatinated it to get one string value
 * Slither was set equal to "anaconda"
 * Inputted it. It worked.

FIND password
 * Looked through the code
 * Followed code logic
 * Got chars array
   * Decoded it to an int array
   * Decoded it to a char array
   * Password was accepted

SUBMITTING
 * Flag was not accepted as chars
 * Googled it a bit
 * Challenge author mentioned that you needed to double check the password checker
 * After double checking, I realized that the password checker code was very buggy

MOVING FORWARD
 * In the process of editing the password checker code so I can re decrypt the password, and verify it's validity this time.
