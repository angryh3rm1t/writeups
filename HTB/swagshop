SERVICE ENUMERATION:
	OpenSSH 7.2p2
	Looked up ‘SSH 7.2’ in https://www.exploit-db.com/
	Found potential exploits to use. Will plan to search potential exploits within MSF. 
	Will save these results for later, should MSF exploit attemps prove unsuccessful.

HTTP ENUMERATION:
	Apache httpd 2.4.18
	Passive Reconnaissance: Burp Suite
		Setting up Burp Suite:
			Firefox Config:
				127.0.0.1:8080
				Use this proxy server for all protocols
				Download and import Burp CA Cert fmor http://burp
			Burp Config:
				Proxy > Intercept > Off
			Firefox Config:
				About:config
				Security.tls.version.max → set to 3
		Collect information
	Active Reconnaissance: gobuster
		gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://10.10.10.140/ -o dirb2Results.txt
		Look through these directories
		Found Magento
			Inputted to searchsploit
			Found exploits varied by version number, need to verify version number
				Found date on website, googled it. Found a listing for an exploit that was outputted from searchploit query
				Magento CE < 1.9.0.1 Authenticated
				Realized Magento CE stood for Community Edition, this is not what I’m looking for
			Googled full name from bottom “agento 2014 demo store”
				Found an ecommerce exploit on google. It is also in my searchsploit output. This is what I want.
				Magento eCommerce - Remote Code Execut | exploits/xml/webapps/37977.py
				This will give me admin creds
EXPLOITATION:
	Exploit attempt 1: remote code execution: 37977.py
		Learned how the code worked. Executed. Failed. Tried several times, but don’t know why. Moving on.
	Exploit attempt 2: Local File Disclos | exploits/php/webapps/19793.txt
		Less comfortable with this type of exploit, so will go back to it if I must
	Exploit attempt 3: CEauth.py
		Can’t figure out how this type of exploit works, so move on for now
	Exploit attempt 4: Magento 1.2 - '/app/code/core/Mage/Admin/Model/Session.php?login['U | exploits/php/webapps/32808.txt
		I recognize this directory from my dirbuster output
		I attempt to reach this directory through the browser, i am successful.
		I believe this is the path I should take.
		Failed. Found the exact version (finally) of Magento. It was v1.9.0.0. This is not a valid attack
	Exploit attempt 5: Magento < 2.0.6 - Arbitrary Unserialize / Arbitrary Write File
		This should be effective, as I am now confident of the version number of software. The only hurdle should be proper execution of the exploit
		After several attempts, seems unsuccessful.
		This exploit depends on finding a GET request, which never seems to appear during the indicated time
		May return to this, as [based on the information i’ve accumulated] should be successful based off the version number…
	Exploit attempt 6:  remote code execution: 37977.py
		Tried it again
		Realized the path i was attempted wasn’t working in the browser
		Server overload error
		Kept on 
		Trying to enter through browser
		When the broswer let me in, i ran the exploit
		SUCCESSFUL
			Creds created: forme, forme

PROGRESS STATUS: Have credentials for the admin panel of the web server. Goal is to get read access to the file directory

PLAN MOVING FORWARD:
Current status: admin creds for web console
	plan: Use Magento Connect to upload php file
		Magento Connect stopped being a working link
		Unsure as to why, but will simply have to work with this new reality
	Plan: searchsploit CVEs
