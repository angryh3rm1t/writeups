ENUMERATION
 * netdiscover
   * target IP address: 192.168.56.104
 * Manual Observation through Browser
   * Gives default Apache splashscreen
   * Tried navigating to /admin, /logs, /index.php, /robots.txt. No success with any of these.
 * sudo nmap -v -sS -A -Pn -T5 -p- -oN scan.txt 192.168.56.104 
   * Port 80: Apache 2.4.29
   * OS: Linux (Version is unconfirmed)
 * dirb http://192.168.56.104 /usr/share/wordlist/dirb/common.txt
   * Found several directories
   * Main parents branches: javascript, wordpress
 * Manual Observation through Browser
   * Navigated to /wordpress, and was greeted with a generic vulnerable webapp. 
     * Several links throughout the page
     * A search bar input field exists
     * A comment input field exists
     * A login input field exists
   * Navigated to /javascript, however was told I didn't have permission to access this page
     * Will have to come back to this...

TAKEAWAYS
 * Seems that this box is strictly a webapp attack challenge. No ports other than 80 are open. Just is a vulnerable wordpress page, and a suspicioud javascript directory.

ATTACKING /WORDPRESS
 * sqlmap -u "http://192.168.56.104/wordpress/?s*=hi" --batch --level 5
   * Output told me that no injected parameters were acceptable exploits
   * I believe the issue is the url I'm providing it.
