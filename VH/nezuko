 * sudo nmap -v -sS -A -Pn -T5 -p- -oN boxScan.txt 192.168.56.102
   * Port 22: OpenSSH
   * Port 80: Apache
   * Port 13337: WebMin

 * dirb http://192.168.56.102/ /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
   * /index.html
   * /robots.txt

 * Manual Observation of Webpage
   * Navigated to homepage. Did not see much information beyond a gif.
   * Inspected webpage code. Did not see anything out of the ordinary.
   * Attempted navigating to directories listed through Dirbuster. Found nothing promising.

PLAN OF ATTACK
 * Look for vulnerabilities in Port 13337 due to suspicious port number
   * Could not successfully execute any exploits on vulnerable service WebMin
 * Look for vulnerabilities in Port 80 due to number of vulnerabilities in Apache
   * Still attempting to execute exploits on vulnerabilities
