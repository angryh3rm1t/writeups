ENUMERATION
 * sudo nmap -v -sS -A -Pn -T5 -p- -oN boxScan.txt 192.168.56.102
   * Port 22: OpenSSH
   * Port 80: Apache
   * Port 13337: WebMin

 * dirb http://192.168.56.102/ /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
   * /index.html
   * /robots.txt
   * /server-status

 * Manual Observation of Webpage
   * Navigated to homepage. Did not see much information beyond a gif.
   * Inspected webpage code. Did not see anything out of the ordinary.
   * Attempted navigating to directories listed through Dirbuster. Found nothing promising.

PLAN OF ATTACK
 * Look for vulnerabilities in Port 13337 due to suspicious port number
   * Could not successfully execute any exploits on vulnerable service WebMin
 * Look for vulnerabilities in Port 80 due to number of vulnerabilities in Apache
   * Still attempting to execute exploits on vulnerabilities
   * Could not find anything through this rabbit hole. 

I decide to take a look at something suspicious i found when manually visiting Dirbuster directories
 * Navigated to IPADDRESS/robots.txt
 * I am presented with a string of text. No numbers. But ends with '===='
 * At first glance I thought it was a md5 hash, and so dismissed this lead as useless. But upon further inspection, i realized the '====' must mean something. 
 * Upon some research, I learn that this is a end marker for Base64 code. 
 * I decide to decode the string with a Base64 decoder. Unfortunately it yields gibberish. 
 * I then decide to decode the string with a Base32 decoder. This attempt is successful
 * However the output is simply a hint telling me to try enumerating another service than this one.

I decide now that I wanted to attempt to break into Port 13337 again. My gut tells me it's the correct direction
 * I look for more exploits, but cannot get any to work. 
 * At this point I allow myself to look at a guide. The guide at this point directs me to the first script I found - it turns out I had been using it incorrectly this entire time
 * I follow the guide's usage of the script, and it executes correctly.
 * However, this script simply tests for a vulnerablity in the service that allows for RCE. It must be modified to send a shell back to my attack box.
 * I add a netcat call into a curl call.
 * I start listening with netcat on my attack box. I then run the script.
 * I am rewarded with a shell.

PWNED
