 * Manual Observation through Browser
   * Through benign user interaction (clicking on links):
     * Three webpages accessable through site links:
       * Welcome Page
       * About Us
       * Contact Us
     * Welcome Page and About Us just have basic text on the screen. Nothing intersting seems to be going on. 
     * Contact Us page has input fields. Should be useful later.
   * Through typing into URL:
     * Do not have permission to navigate to main directories outputted from dirb results
     * robots.txt works
     * There are too many ouputs listed from dirb to try them all, and no other files/directories stand out, so I decide to move on

MOVING FORWARD
 * Seems like Port 22 might be the end goal since that's where MFA is implemented. However I don't immediately see anything vulnerable with it. More research needs to be done on if it's version has an vulnerabilities
 * The brightest path right now appears to be enumerating and testing out navigating throughout the website through the browser.

ENUMERATION
 * Analyzed robots.txt 
   * Led me to find /CHANGELOG.txt
 * /CHANGELOG.txt gave me the exact version number of the Drupal server software
   * This is the most up to date software available. 
   * No vulnerabilities I could find through research
 * Checked OpenSSH 7.4p1 vulnerabilities 
   * No critical vulnerabilities.
   * 2 low level vulns exist, which allow viewing of usernames and submitting zero length files.
 * This tells me that I can't rely on a common vulnerability to exploit in either SSH or HTTP
 * The only attack vectors I see at this point are:
   * Searching through directories I can access through the browser
   * Attackign the site through user input fields left behind in the 'Contact Us' webpage.
